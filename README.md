Project Overview
The project consists of two main phases:

#### *Phase 1: Data preparation and analysis, including segmentation of customers by age, income, and spending behavior.
#### *Phase 2: Campaign design, execution, and analysis for a targeted age group, including A/B testing to evaluate campaign success.

Data Analysis and Key Insights
Phase 1: Data Preparation & Exploratory Analysis
Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, handled outliers, and removed duplicates in customer data (such as annual income and age).
Customer Segmentation: Created segments based on age groups and analyzed their income levels, spending behaviors, and popular purchasing categories.
Visualization: Used histograms, bar charts, and box plots to visualize income distribution, spending categories, and demographics.
Phase 2: Campaign Design & Hypothesis Testing
Campaign Focus: Concentrated on customers aged 18-24, a group that makes up a significant share of the credit card base but has lower average credit scores and spending limits.
Statistical Analysis: Employed A/B testing (Z-test) to evaluate the difference in transaction amounts between a test group (exposed to the campaign) and a control group.
Sample Size Optimization: Adjusted the sample size based on budget constraints and effect size calculations, ensuring efficient use of resources.
Results and Findings
The 18-24 age group shows distinct preferences for categories like Fashion, Electronics, and Beauty, with Amazon as the most popular platform.
A targeted campaign toward this group significantly increased the average transaction amount compared to the control group, demonstrating the campaign's effectiveness.
Usage Instructions
Phase 1 Analysis:

Review the data preparation, customer segmentation, and visualization results for an in-depth understanding of customer demographics and spending habits.
Phase 2 Campaign Testing:

Examine the statistical analysis and campaign testing outcomes to understand how the targeted campaign was designed and validated using hypothesis testing.
